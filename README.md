Install the npm packages described in the package.json and verify that it works:

```bash
# Install the dependencies
npm install

# Run
npm start
```

The npm start command first compiles the application. Both the compiler and the server watch for file changes.

Shut it down manually with Ctrl-C.

You're ready to write your application.# angularjs2-login
